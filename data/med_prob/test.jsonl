The energy efficiency of the cell is comparable to any machine so far invented. ATP captures the chemical energy released by the combustion of nutrients and transfers it to synthetic reactions that require energy. iii. At rest, Na+-K+ -ATPase (see Chapter 2) uses up one-third of all ATP formed. Other energy requiring processes are, biosynthesis of macromolecules, muscle contractions, cellular motion using kinesin, dynein, etc. iv. ATP is continually being hydrolyzed and regenerated.

POLYOL PATHWAY OF GLUCOSE - Sorbitol is very poorly absorbed from intestine. It involves the reduction of glucose by aldose reductase to sorbitol, which can then be oxidized to fructose. This would amount to the interconversion of glucose to fructose. Glucose when conveed to sorbitol, cannot diffuse out of the cell easily and gets trapped there. Sorbitol is normally present in lens of eyes. But in diabetes mellitus, when glucose level is high, the sorbitol concentration also increases in the lens.

{"question": "Iron overload", "exp": "Normal plasma contains very little ferritin. Ferritin in plasma is elevated in iron overload. Thus ferritin level in blood is an index of body iron stores. iv. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant protein that is elevated in inflammatory diseases. Estimation of ferritin is also indicated in chronic kidney disease to assess the extent of anemia. v. Synthesis of TfR and ferritin and that of ferritin are reciprocally controlled. Both are controlled by the iron content. When iron levels are high, ferritin is synthesized to store the iron; but the TfR synthesis is blocked. When iron levels are high, iron binds to iron-response-element- binding-protein (IREBP), preventing it from binding to IRE. This will result in synthesis of new ferritin, and suppression of synthesis of TfR. Transferrin receptors (TfR) are present on most of the body cells, especially on cells which synthesize heme. The iron-transferrin complex is taken up by the body cells by the receptor mechanism. The transferrin receptor has a molecular weight of 200 kD. It binds two molecules of transferrin. The iron-transferrin- receptor is internalized. Iron is taken in by the cells, and receptor molecules are externalized. vii. Transferrin is a glycoprotein.

Since repair mechanism is not operating, these mutations are accumulated, leading to cancer. There is sensitivity to ultraviolet rays; sunlight causes blisters on the skin. Avoiding sunlight and using sunscreen ointment will be beneficial. Patients with XP have a 1000-fold greater chance of developing skin cancer than do normal persons.

It is also called Myringostapediopexy or Columella tympanoplasty. Type IV Only the footplate of stapes is present. It is exposed to the external ear, and graft is placed between the oval and round windows. A narrow middle ear (cavum minor) is thus created to have an air pocket around the round window. A mucosa-lined space extends from the eustachian tube to the round window. Sound waves in this case act directly on the footplate while the round window has been shielded. Type V Stapes footplate is fixed but round window is functioning. In such cases, another window is created on horizontal semicircular canal and covered with a graft.
