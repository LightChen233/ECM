It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?\n[[Answer]] It took Leo 25 x 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 minutes to finish the second part of the assignment.\nLeo finished the first and second parts of the assignment in 25 + 50 = <<25+50=75>>75 minutes.\nHe finished the entire assignment in 60 x 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 minutes.\nTherefore, it took Leo 120 - 75 = <<120-75=45>>45 minutes to finish the third part of the assignment.\n#### 45\n\n[[Example Question]] Liza bought 10 kilograms of butter to make cookies. She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?\n[[Answer]] Liza used 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 kilograms of butter for the chocolate chip cookies.\nThen, she used 10/5 = <<10/5=2>>2 kilograms of butter for the peanut butter cookies.\nShe used 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 kilograms of butter for the chocolate and peanut butter cookies.\nSo, only 10 -7 = <<10-7=3>>3 kilograms of butter was left.\nThen, Liza used 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1 kilograms of butter for the sugar cookies.\nTherefore, only 3-1 = <<3-1=2>>2 kilograms of butter were left.\n#### 2\n\n[[Example Question]] Tina makes $18 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n[[Answer]] She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = $<<8*18=144>>144 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes $18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*0.5 = $<<18*0.5=9>>9\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = $<<18+9=27>>27\nHer base pay is $144 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720>>720\nHer overtime pay is $27 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = $<<27*2=54>>54 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = $270\nIn 5 days her base pay is $720 and she makes $270 in overtime pay so she makes $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990>>990\n#### 990\n\n[[Question]] """,
