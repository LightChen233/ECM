"[[Example Question]] Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?\n\n[[Answer]] It took Leo 25 x 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 minutes to finish the second part of the assignment.\nLeo finished the first and second parts of the assignment in 25 + 50 = <<25+50=75>>75 minutes.\nHe finished the entire assignment in 60 x 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 minutes.\nTherefore, it took Leo 120 - 75 = <<120-75=45>>45 minutes to finish the third part of the assignment.\n#### 45\n\n[[Example Question]] Liza bought 10 kilograms of butter to make cookies. She used one-half of it for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth of it for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remaining butter for sugar cookies. How many kilograms of butter are left after making those three kinds of cookies?\n\n[[Answer]] Liza used 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 kilograms of butter for the chocolate chip cookies.\nThen, she used 10/5 = <<10/5=2>>2 kilograms of butter for the peanut butter cookies.\nShe used 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 kilograms of butter for the chocolate and peanut butter cookies.\nSo, only 10 - 7 = <<10-7=3>>3 kilograms of butter were left.\nThen, Liza used 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1 kilogram of butter for the sugar cookies.\nTherefore, 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 kilograms of butter were left.\n#### 2\n\n[[Example Question]] Tina makes $18 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid at her hourly wage plus half of her hourly wage. If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n\n[[Answer]] She works 8 hours a day for $18 per hour, so she makes 8 * 18 = $<<8*18=144>>144 per 8-hour shift.\nShe works 10 hours a day, and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she works 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours of overtime.\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half, which means she makes $18 + (18 * 0.5) = $<<18+9=27>>27 per overtime hour.\nHer base pay is $144 per 8-hour shift, and she works 5 days, making 5 * $144 = $<<144*5=720>>720 total for standard hours.\nHer overtime pay is $27 per hour, and she works 2 hours of overtime each day, making 27 * 2 = $<<27*2=54>>54 per day in overtime.\n2 hours of overtime for 5 days means she earns 54 * 5 = $270 in overtime pay.\nIn 5 days, her base pay is $720, and she makes $270 in overtime pay, so her total earnings are $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990>>990.\n#### 990\n\n[[Question]]"

Total used: 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 kg.\n4. **Remaining Butter**: Subtract used butter from total. Remaining: 10 - 7 = <<10-7=3>>3 kg.\n5. **Butter for Sugar Cookies**: Calculate one-third of remaining butter. 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1 kg.\n6. **Final Remaining Butter**: Subtract butter used for sugar cookies. Leftover: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 kg.\n#### 2\n\n[[Example Question]] \nTina makes $18 an hour. If she works over 8 hours per shift, overtime is paid at 1.5 times her hourly wage. If she works 10 hours daily for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n\n[[Answer]] \n1. **Regular Earnings**: For 8 hours, calculate earnings. Regular: 8 x $18 = $<<8*18=144>>144 per shift.\n2. **Overtime Calculation**: Calculate hours over 8. Overtime: 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours.\n3. **Overtime Rate**: Overtime rate is 1.5 times regular. $18 + 18 x 0.5 = $<<18+9=27>>27/hour.\n4. **Regular Earnings for 5 Days**: Total regular earnings: 5 x $144 = $<<144*5=720>>720.\n5. **Overtime Earnings for 5 Days**: Calculate total overtime earnings. $27 x 2 x 5 = $<<27*2*5=270>>270.\n6. **Total Earnings**: Add regular and overtime.

If she works 10 hours daily for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n\n[[Answer]] \n1. **Calculate Standard Earnings**: For 8 hours, calculate the earnings for a regular shift. Regular earnings: 8 hours/day x $18/hour = $<<8*18=144>>144 per shift.\n2. **Determine Overtime Hours**: Calculate the number of overtime hours worked each day. Overtime: 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours.\n3. **Calculate Overtime Rate**: Calculate the overtime pay rate as 1.5 times the regular hourly wage. Overtime rate: $18 + (18 x 0.5) = $<<18+9=27>>27/hour.\n4. **Calculate Total Regular Earnings Over 5 Days**: Multiply the standard earnings by the number of days worked. Standard earnings for 5 days: 5 x $144 = $<<144*5=720>>720.\n5. **Calculate Total Overtime Earnings Over 5 Days**: Compute the total overtime earnings by multiplying the overtime pay by the overtime hours per day and the total number of days. Overtime earnings: $27/hour x 2 hours/day x 5 days = $<<27*2*5=270>>270.\n6. **Calculate Total Earnings for 5 Days**: Add the regular and overtime earnings to determine the total amount earned over the period. Total earnings: $720 (base) + $270 (overtime) = $<<720+270=990>>990.\n#### 990\n\n[[Question]]"

"[[Example Question]] Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If his total time on the assignment was 2 hours, how long did the third part take in minutes?\n\n[[Answer]]\n1. **Calculate Time for Second Part**: Multiply the time for the first part by 2. It took Leo 25 x 2 = <<25*2=50>>50 minutes to finish the second part. Verify: 25 x 2 = 50.\n2. **Calculate Total for First Two Parts**: Add the times for the first and second parts. Total time for these parts: 25 + 50 = <<25+50=75>>75 minutes. Verify: 25 + 50 = 75.\n3. **Convert Total Assignment Time**: Convert the total assignment time from hours to minutes. Total time: 2 hours x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes. Verify conversion.\n4. **Calculate Time for Third Part**: Subtract the time for the first two parts from the total assignment time. Time for third part: 120 - 75 = <<120-75=45>>45 minutes. Verify: 120 - 75 = 45.\n#### 45\n\n[[Example Question]] Liza bought 10 kg of butter for cookies. She used one-half for chocolate chip cookies, one-fifth for peanut butter cookies, and one-third of the remainder for sugar cookies. How much butter remains?\n\n[[Answer]]\n1. **Butter for Chocolate Chip Cookies**: Calculate half of the butter. Used: 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 kg. Verify: 10/2 = 5.\n2. **Butter for Peanut Butter Cookies**: Calculate one-fifth of the butter. Used: 10/5 = <<10/5=2>>2 kg. Verify: 10/5 = 2.\n3. **Total Used for First Two Types**: Sum the butter used for chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies. Total: 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 kg. Verify: 5 + 2 = 7.\n4. **Remaining Butter**: Subtract total used from initial amount. Remaining: 10 - 7 = <<10-7=3>>3 kg. Verify: 10 - 7 = 3.\n5. **Butter for Sugar Cookies**: Calculate one-third of the remaining butter. Used: 3/3 = <<3/3=1>>1 kg. Verify: 3/3 = 1.\n6. **Final Butter Left**: Subtract amount used for sugar cookies. Left: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 kg. Verify: 3 - 1 = 2.\n#### 2\n\n[[Example Question]] Tina makes $18 an hour, with overtime paid at 1.5 times the hourly wage. Working 10 hours a day for 5 days, what are her earnings?\n\n[[Answer]]\n1. **Daily Regular Earnings**: Calculate earnings for 8 hours. Pay: 8 x $18 = $<<8*18=144>>144. Verify: 8 x 18 = 144.\n2. **Daily Overtime**: Determine overtime hours. Overtime: 10 - 8 = <<10-8=2>>2 hours. Verify: 10 - 8 = 2.\n3. **Overtime Rate**: Calculate pay rate for overtime. Rate: $18 + (18 x 0.5) = $<<18+9=27>>27/hour. Verify: 18 + 9 = 27.\n4. **Total Regular Earnings for 5 Days**: Calculate total from regular hours. Total: 5 x $144 = $<<144*5=720>>720. Verify: 5 x 144 = 720.\n5. **Total Overtime Earnings for 5 Days**: Compute total overtime pay. Total: $27 x 2 x 5 = $<<27*2*5=270>>270. Verify: 27 x 2 x 5 = 270.\n6. **Total Earnings for 5 Days**: Add regular and overtime earnings. Total: $720 + $270 = $<<720+270=990>>990. Verify: 720 + 270 = 990.\n#### 990\n\n[[Question]]"
