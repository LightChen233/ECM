How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders and the homemade ones first.\n\nLet x be the number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders. Then, the homemade bird feeders attract x + 1706 birds.\n\nSince each bird feeder attracts 3 birds, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is 15x, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade bird feeders is 15(x + 1706).\n\nGiven that Lillian has both types of bird feeders, the total number of birds attracted to her garden each day is:\n\n15x + 15(x + 1706) = 15x + 15x + 25602\n= 30x + 25602\n\nSince the same number of birds keep coming to her bird feeders, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is constant. Therefore, we can set it equal to the total number of birds attracted in the beginning:\n\n30x + 25602 = 0\n30x = -25602\nx = -25602/30\nx = -853.4\n\nThis means that the number of birds attracted by the store-bought bird feeders is negative, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement. Let's try to redo the calculation:\n\nLet's assume the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is x, \nSo, the total number of birds attracted by the homemade bird feeders would be x + 1706.\n\nNow, we know that each feeder attracts 3 birds. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by store-bought feeders is 3x and homemade feeders is 3(x + 1706).\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds attracted by all feeders is equal to 15(3x) + 15(3(x + 1706)) \n= 45x + 45(x + 1706)\n= 45x + 45x + 76950 \n= 90x + 76950\n\nTherefore, Lillian can expect to see a total of 90x + 76950 birds in her garden each day."}]}], "origin": {"question": "Lillian's garden doesn't have any bird feeders in it so she wants to add some.
