This adds 498m to the distance.\n\nThen, for each subsequent step, Sam walks back 251 times as far as the previous step. Let's calculate the distance for each step:\n\nStep 1: Moves forward 498m\nStep 2: Walks back 251 times 498m = 498m * 251 = 124,998m\nStep 3: Walks back 251 times 124,998m = 124,998m * 251 = 31,374,498m\nStep 4: Walks back 251 times 31,374,498m = 31,374,498m * 251 = 7,873,624,998m\n...\n\nWe can observe that each subsequent step adds one more \"251\" factor to the calculation.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can express the distance for each step using a recursive formula:\n\nDistance of Step n = Distance of Step (n-1) * 251\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the distance for each step until the step becomes 0 (indicating he is back at the starting point):\n\nStep 1: Moves forward 498m (initial step)\nStep 2: Walks back 498m * 251 = 124,998m\nStep 3: Walks back 124,998m * 251 = 31,374,498m\nStep 4: Walks back 31,374,498m * 251 = 7,873,624,998m\nStep 5: Walks back 7,873,624,998m * 251 = 1,975,150,624,998m\n...\n\nWe can see that the distance keeps getting larger and larger with each step, but we can also observe a pattern. The distance appears to be increasing by approximately 251 times as much with each step.\n\nTo find a general formula for the distance at any given step, we can note that for each step n, the distance is given by:\n\nDistance of Step n = 498m * (251^(n-1))\n\nNow, let's calculate the total distance traveled by summing the distances for each step until the step becomes 0:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance of Step 1 + Distance of Step 2 + Distance of Step 3 + ...\n\nTo simplify this sum, we can rewrite it using a geometric series:\n\nTotal Distance = 498m + 498m * 251 + 498m * 251^2 + ...\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is:\n\nSum = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nwhere:\na = first term of the series = 498m\nr = common ratio = 251\nn = number of terms in the series\n\nIn this case, as n approaches infinity (as Sam keeps taking steps), the sum of the series will approach a limit.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can calculate the total distance:\n\nTotal Distance = 498m * (1 - (251^∞)) / (1 - 251)\n\nSince the common ratio (r) is greater than 1, raising it to the power of infinity would result in an infinite value. However, in this case, we know that as Sam takes more and more steps, the distance won't actually reach infinity. Instead, it will approach a certain limit.\n\nTo calculate this limit, we can express the formula as a limit:\n\nTotal Distance = 498m * lim(n->∞) (1 - (251^n)) / (1 - 251)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the limit:\n\nlim(n->∞) (1 - (251^n))\n\nSince the value of (251^n) will keep increasing indefinitely as n approaches infinity, the value of (1 - (251^n)) will keep getting closer and closer to -infinity.\n\nTherefore, the limit of (1 - (251^n)) as n approaches infinity is -∞.\n\nNow, let's substitute this value back into the formula for the total distance:\n\nTotal Distance = 498m * (-∞) / (1 - 251)\n\nDividing any finite number by -∞ will result in an infinite value.\n\nTherefore, the total distance between Sam's final position and the starting point is infinite.\n\nIn other words, as Sam keeps taking steps, he will never reach the starting point again."}]}], "origin": {"question": "Imagine Sam is strolling down a linear path.\nWhat follows is the record of his journey:\n- he moved forward 498m.\n- he walked back 251 times as far as the previous step.\n\nWhat is the distance between he's final position and the starting point?", "answer": "Let's think step-by-step!\nFor convenience, we set the starting point as the origin, going forward is positive and going backward is negative.\nBecause he moved forward 498m, his distance from the origin is 0+498=<<0+498=498>>498m.\nBecause he walked back 251 times as far as the previous step.

Then, the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders would be x - 7.\n\nSince Lillian built 17 feeders and bought 17 others, the total number of feeders is 17 + 17 = 34.\n\nIf each feeder attracts 70 birds, then the total number of birds attracted by the feeders she made herself is 17x, and the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 17(x - 7).\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds attracted to all the feeders is:\nTotal birds = 17x + 17(x - 7) \n\nGiven that the same amount of birds keeps coming to her bird feeders, we can assume that the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder will remain constant.\n\nSince the total number of birds attracted by all the feeders is the same each day, we can set up the equation:\n\n17x + 17(x - 7) = 34(70)\n\nSolving for x:\n\n17x + 17x - 119 = 2380\n34x = 2499\nx = 73.5\n\nSince we can't have half a bird, we can round down to the nearest whole number.
